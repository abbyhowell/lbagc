# Luna Burn Art Grant Core Website [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/abbyhowell/lbagc.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/abbyhowell/lbagc)

## Initial Environment Setup

Set up the project with:

```sh
  bundle install
  bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
  bin/rails server
```

If you are running this project in production you'll need to set environment variables for secrets that include `ENV` in `config/secrets.yml`.  To generate new "secret" hex values, use `bundle exec rake secret`.  Be careful not to push changes to this file to publicly-accessible repositories!

## Email Setup

If you're using SMTP to send emails, create a hidden file `.env` (it is already ignored by git) that overrides the values you want to set. See `.env.sample` for an example.

## Event-Specific Setup (do this every year)

There are a few changes to make every year:

* Upgrade gems: bundle3.0 install && bundle3.0 update

* Set the year of the event (e.g., "Apply for Luna Burn 2027!") in config/application.rb.

* Check the grant contract templates in lib/contract_templates. Each grant has a template name that must match a contract filename on disk.

* Update the template constants (install dates and deadlines) in config/template_values.yml.

* Update golden files with `bundle exec rake grant_contracts:create_golden` and check the output in spec/fixtures/pdfs

* Make a backup of the previous production table in the db/ folder

* IMPORTANT: Rotate the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` in .env to a new value with `rake secret` 

* Reset the database with `bundle exec rake db:reset RAILS_ENV=production`. THIS WILL DELETE ALL DATA, so you may want to make a backup of the existing db first.

* Copy the grants table into the new production folder:

  * `attach database 'production-20XX.sqlite3' as local;`

  * `insert into grants select * from local.grants;`

  * You can adjust the dates as needed: `update grants set submit_start=DATETIME(submit_start, "+1 year");`

## Run Tests

```sh
  bundle exec rspec
```

## Launch the server

Run the server, which runs on the default port 3000:

```sh
  bundle exec rails s
```

You should create an admin right away by going to the admins page.

# Troubleshooting

I had problems with bundle install not working, and I had to do:

```sh
  bundle install --deployment
```

# Static assets look wrong or are missing

You may need to precompile them for some production environments:

```sh
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```

# The site isn't updating?

You may need to tell apache to reload

```sh
sudo service apache2 reload
```
